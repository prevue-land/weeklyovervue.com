However, <em>someone</em> thought it would be a great idea to use Notion as a headless CMS... let&#39;s say it wasn&#39;t the wisest choice given the sheer size of the very first article alone. Obviously, I&#39;m not saying Notion in general is terrible, far from it, but you may want to consider switching over to an actual CMS as these posts grow bigger.</p><p>After seeking advice from fellow content creators, I&#39;ve decided to migrate over to Netlify CMS, and it&#39;s safe to say I&#39;ll never look back. It offered <strong>exactly what I&#39;d needed</strong> from the outset and the whole configuration process was <strong>smooth as butter</strong>. Despite there being no Vitepress template available, I&#39;d managed to get through the setup process with ease, and I didn&#39;t have to change hosting from Github Pages over to Netlify, all despite the name.</p><p>From this point on, it&#39;s all about tweaking this setup, gradually improving it to accommodate my needs, but the toughest part is over in that regard. <strong>This WAS NOT a sponsored post</strong> by the way... after all, that&#39;s what Weekly OverVue is for - it serves as an outlet for me to share amazing community resources with its other members. Although this time I admit I didn&#39;t really go through all the bits and details of my configuration and the whole post may legitimately be read as a gigantic ad... I just like writing <em>without a plan</em> at times, hahaha.</p><p>Have a nice weekend, and remember - <strong>Mac believes in you!</strong></p>',5),i=[r];function n(l,h,m,c,p,u){return o(),t("div",null,i)}var f=e(s,[["render",n]]);export{g as __pageData,f as default};
