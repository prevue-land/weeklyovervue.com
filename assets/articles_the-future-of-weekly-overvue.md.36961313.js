It&#39;s a clear signal that the strategy I&#39;ve initially adopted doesn&#39;t work too well, so in this issue I&#39;d like to outline what&#39;s next for this project.</p><p><strong>SPOILER ALERT</strong>: it&#39;s <strong>not</strong> getting cancelled!</p><p>I genuinely like the idea of showcasing community Vue/Nuxt components in small and <em>close-to-real-life</em> demos, which could serve as a foundation for a proper full-stack app. I can definitely say the same about writing up the whole development process, laying out all the <em>specs</em> and explaining some of the less-obvious Vue/TS tricks I&#39;ve opted to use and why...</p><p>But here&#39;s where we get to the actual problem. I&#39;d realised it was incredibly difficult for me to keep up with the weekly release schedule, while also doing all the schoolwork, preparing for different kinds of tests, and so on...</p><p>Therefore, I&#39;ve made a decision to revamp my <em>content delivery strategy</em>. From now on, <strong>up to 2</strong> tutorial articles will be released each month. <strong>Every new demo</strong>, though, will get a dedicated newsletter issue straight after release. These will cover the showcased community component, a brief description of the app, as well as a list of features you could (and totally should) try implementing yourself.</p><p>This approach, however, makes the whole project name irrelevant, since it&#39;s no longer based on content delivered consistently each 7 days. With that in mind, I came up with a brand new name: <strong>PreVue Land</strong>. I&#39;m confident it makes for a significantly better <em>description</em> of the initiative, given the new formula.</p><p><em>But what about the <a href="http://weeklyovervue.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weeklyovervue.com</a> domain name?</em> <em>Are you going to hold on to it?</em> The answer is - <strong>no</strong>, at least not for too long, since I&#39;ll have to migrate everything over to <em><a href="http://prevueland.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prevueland.com</a></em>, change all the references, emails, and such...</p><p>I do, however, own a bunch of other unused domain names on NameCheap I&#39;d like to sell via the Marketplace, with the entire profit going straight to the Ukrainian Red Cross. After all, I don&#39;t have to explain the dire situation my eastern neighbours are currently in, and by donating all the domain name sale money, I could genuinely contribute to improving many innocent lives.</p><p>The domain names in question are:</p><ul><li>chip-8.club ($10)</li><li><a href="http://quicktonne.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quicktonne.com</a> ($15)</li><li>stealywheelyautomobiley.live ($15)</li><li><a href="http://queuestanders.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">queuestanders.com</a> ($20)</li></ul><p>They will be listed for 15 days, so grab them while you still can! And as always, thank you so much reading in, and I&#39;ll see you in the first <strong>PreVue Land</strong> issue.</p><p>Take care!</p><p>Mac</p>',16),i=[r];function s(l,p,h,u,c,d){return o(),t("div",null,i)}var f=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,f as default};
