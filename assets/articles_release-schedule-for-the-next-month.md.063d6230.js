I figured these would probably be a better fit for the <em>Release Radar</em> newsletter, but since I&#39;d also promised to release two articles this weekend... here we are. So if you find this type of content useful, make sure to sign up for said newsletter via a special form on the home page or <a href="https://twitter.com/WeeklyOverVue" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via its Twitter profile</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Knowing Mac (and his luck when he needs it most), both the article publishing dates as well as their topics themselves <strong>are subject to change</strong>. With that out of the way, here are <strong>four</strong> upcoming Weekly OverVue articles in their (provisional) release order:</p><ol><li><em>Jewelry Store -</em> online jewelry store demo built using <a href="https://mayashavin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Maya Shavin</a>&#39;s <em>Vurian</em> wizard component and XState.

Coming <strong>February 27</strong></li><li><em>Survey Builder</em> - I&#39;m confident this name speaks for itself; it will make use of <a href="https://formkit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FormKit</a> not only for previewing a questionnaire, but also generating it! Coming <strong>March 6</strong></li><li><em>Tic Tac Toe</em> - another project that needs no introduction; built using <a href="https://github.com/SaFrMo/vue3-boardgame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vue3-boardgame</a> plugin.
