Hello and welcome back to Weekly OverVue! My name is Mac, and this week I'll show you how to build a Tic Tac Toe game using the **[vue3-boardgame](https://github.com/SaFrMo/vue3-boardgame/)** plugin written by [Sander Moolin](https://github.com/SaFrMo). While this idea may seem generic and unambitious, I've failed to find any proper examples showcasing Vue 3 and [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) together. So why not take the latter's own Tic Tac Toe tutorial, introducing some custom styling and the aforementioned plugin into the mix? With that said, let's get down to the setup.

## Project configuration

Now, begin by cloning the *Blank Canvas* template into a `tic-tac-toe` folder (feel free to choose any other name if you want) and installing all the dependencies, while also removing Pinia:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/weekly-overvue/blank-canvas.git tic-tac-toe
$ cd tic-tac-toe
$ npm install
$ npm uninstall --save pinia
```

Once that's done, open up your favourite code editor and go to the `main.ts` file in `src` directory. Go ahead and remove these lines:

```typescript
// ...
import { createPinia } from 'pinia';

// ...

app.use(createPinia());

```

Then move over to `App.vue` file in that same folder. Remove the entire `<header>` element inside the `<template>`, as well as the `nav` element styling rule down in the `<style>` tag.
