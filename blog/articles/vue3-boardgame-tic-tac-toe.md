Hello and welcome back to Weekly OverVue! My name is Mac, and this week I'll show you how to build a Tic Tac Toe game using the **[vue3-boardgame](https://github.com/SaFrMo/vue3-boardgame/)** plugin written by [Sander Moolin](https://github.com/SaFrMo). While this idea may seem generic and unambitious, I've failed to find any proper examples showcasing Vue 3 and [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) together. So why not take the latter's own Tic Tac Toe tutorial, introducing some custom styling and the aforementioned plugin into the mix? With that said, let's get down to the setup.

## Installing packages and removing redundant content

Begin by cloning the *Blank Canvas* template into a `tic-tac-toe` folder (feel free to choose any other name if you want) and installing all the dependencies, while also removing Pinia:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/weekly-overvue/blank-canvas.git tic-tac-toe
$ cd tic-tac-toe
$ npm install
$ npm uninstall --save pinia
```

Once that's done, open up your favourite code editor and go to the `main.ts` file in `src` directory. Go ahead and remove these lines:

```typescript
// ...
import { createPinia } from 'pinia';

// ...

app.use(createPinia());
```

Then move over to `App.vue` file in that same folder. Remove the entire `<header>` element inside the `<template>`, as well as the `nav` element styling rule down in the `<style>` tag. Now add `main` element to the `width: 100%; height: 100%` rule, and also `justify-content: center;` to the separate `main` styling rule. And last but not least, let's reset each `h1` tag's top margin for a good measure. It's quite a description, so let me visualise all the changes for you:

```css
html,
body,
#app,
main {
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
}

/* ... */

h1 {
  margin-top: 0;
}

main {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

That's it for our little *demolition job*. From here on, it's all about building upon and working with the baseline we've got.

## Writing custom type definitions for our boardgame.io client

Before we start implementing the [boardgame.io](https://boardgame.io/) client, we need to take a step back to introduce the library we're about to use, as well as its most fundamental concepts. So, boardgame.io describes itself as an *Open Source Game Engine for Turn-Based Games*, enabling one to focus on defining game's actual logic via its **state**, **moves**, or even **phases and stages** for more complex cases. There's also support for **AI** players, **multiplayer** mode, state immutability and **so much more**, but these (along with phases and stages) are outside of this tutorial's scope.

With that out of the way, let's take a moment to actually familiarise ourselves with some of these terms I've just brought up:

* **State** (`G`) represents a *game-specific* data object, which is designed and managed by none other than **you** yourself. In other words, it's pretty much the same as your average Pinia store's state
* **Moves** are essentially functions responsible for altering the aforementioned game state. They can be compared to Vuex mutations, as they manipulate the state directly and **without** causing any side-effects.
* **Context** (`ctx`) provides read-only game metadata such as current turn's, phase's, or player's ID, total number of players, etc. Boardgame.io is responsible for managing it, with us being solely the *consumers* of all that data.

It's high time we got down to the practical part by creating type definitions for our boardgame.io client. Create a `types` folder with an `index.ts` file inside. Let's begin with our state:

```typescript
export type Player = '0' | '1';

export type PossibleCellValue = Player | null;

export type State = {
  cells: PossibleCellValue[];
};

export type SetupFunction = () => State;
```

There's nothing worth explaining here, so let's move on to the context and moves:

```typescript
import type { Ctx, Move } from 'boardgame.io';

// under the state type definitions...

export type GameOver = { winner: Player | 'draw' };

export type CustomCtx = Omit<Ctx, 'currentPlayer' | 'gameover'> & {
  currentPlayer: Player;
  gameover?: GameOver;
};

export type Moves = { markCell: Move<State, CustomCtx> };
```

Now that's a more interesting snippet, especially when it comes to that `CustomCtx` type. But what exactly is going on here? I'll break it down.

First, we make use of a special [`Omit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#omittype-keys) utility type to create a clone of boardgame.io's own `Ctx` type, but without the `currentPlayer` and `gameover` fields. We then merge the resulting type with an anonymous one containing the exact same property names we've just excluded, but with different types assigned to them. In other words: we've just overridden specific fields of an existing type object.

## Defining actual client's state/moves and Vue plugin setup

That's about it for the type definition part. Let's move on to writing actual client configuration code! Our Tic Tac Toe game's **state** should only need a simple array of 9 cells, since the original makes use of a 3x3 square board. As for the **moves**, each player needs to be able to mark such cell, unless it's already been taken. This was the spec, here's its code equivalent:

```typescript
import { Client } from 'boardgame.io/client';
import { INVALID_MOVE } from 'boardgame.io/core';

import { State, CustomCtx, Moves, SetupFunction } from './types';

const setup: SetupFunction = () => ({
  cells: new Array(9).fill(null)
});

const moves: Moves = {
  markCell(G, ctx, index) {
    if (G.cells[index] !== null) {
      return INVALID_MOVE;
    }

    G.cells[index] = ctx.currentPlayer;
  }
};

const game = { setup, moves };

export const client = Client<State, CustomCtx>({ game });

export type BoardgameIoClient = typeof client;
```

One thing I believe should be pointed out, is that boardgame.io doesn't actually provide any *public* type annotations for a client instance. Fortunately, we can make amends for it by creating a custom type set to `typeof client`, which I believe is rather self-explanatory. I also reckon it's best for it to be placed separately from all the other types, because in that case I would have to import `client.ts` over at `types/index.ts`, and I find this kind of mutual dependency a bit awkward.

Alright, now that we've tackled the initial client setup, let's register the boardgame.io Vue 3 plugin. Open the `main.ts` file your src folder and modify it like so:

```typescript
import { createApp } from 'vue';
import { boardgamePlugin } from 'vue3-boardgame';

import App from './App.vue';
import router from './router';
import { client } from './client';

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(boardgamePlugin, {
  useProvide: true,
  useMixin: false,
  autostart: false,
  client
});
app.use(router);

app.mount('#app');
```

By default, the vue3-boardgame plugin makes use of mixins instead of the providing reactive refs of the baordgame.io objects I've mentioned. Since this tutorial aims to showcase SFCs utilising the Composition API rather than the Options counterpart, we have to change this behaviour. I've also opted to manually start the client in a dedicated *Game* view we'll code in a minute. But before that, let's design a simple menu in the *Home* view.

## Creating a borderline basic main menu, because why not

First of all, let's write a simple, reusable `BlockButton.vue` component in the `components` directory (create one in the `src` folder if it doesn't exist). Go ahead and paste in this code block for the file:

```html
<template>
  <button class="block-button">
    <slot></slot>
  </button>
</template>

<style scoped>
.block-button {
  width: 100%;
  margin-bottom: 1rem;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  background-color: #35495e;
  color: white;
  border: none;
  text-align: center;
  transition: 0.3s;
}

button:hover {
  background-color: #42b883;
  color: #000;
  outline: none;
}
</style>
```

Then head over to `HomeView.vue` file in the `views` folder and remove the *Have fun!* message (but keep it in mind yo!). Before you add any markup, add this little script tag above the `<template>` to import both the newly created `BlockButton` and `RouterLink` components. Once that's done, create a div with a title `<h1>` tag and buttons wrapped in router links inside, just like so:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
import { RouterLink } from 'vue-router';
import BlockButton from '@/components/BlockButton.vue';
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <h1>vue3-boardgame Tic Tac Toe</h1>
    <RouterLink to="/game">
      <BlockButton>PLAY!</BlockButton>
    </RouterLink>
    <RouterLink to="/about">
      <BlockButton>About</BlockButton>
    </RouterLink>
  </div>
</template>
```

Make sure to save your changes and use `npm run dev` command in your CLI. You should be greeted with a dev server URL, and upon opening the page in your web browser, you should be able to see this:

## Coding up a Tic Tac Toe Board component

Right now, if you click the *PLAY!* button, you'll be taken to a blank page. This is because we're yet to register a `/game` route in our application. Even worse, we don't even have a dedicated view for it - let's fix that. But before we get down to writing the actual view, we'll need two things: a helper function to return an HTML entity based on given player character, as well as the aforementioned board component.

Ok then, create a `utils` directory and a `playerHtmlEntity.ts` file inside. Here we'll want to export a function which takes a single argument of the `PossibleCellValue` type and returns an empty string for `null`, circle HTML entity for `'0'`, and finally a cross entity for `'1'`. Here's how we can turn this spec into code:

```typescript
import { PossibleCellValue } from '@/types';

export function playerHtmlEntity(character: PossibleCellValue) {
  const entityMap = {
    '0': '&#9711;', // circle
    '1': '&#10005;' // cross
  };

  return character === null ? '' : entityMap[character];
}
```

That was rather straightforward, so it's time to take care of the game board component. As you probably know, it's comprised of 3 rows and 3 columns of square cells, and it's usually drawn without the outer border like in this article's cover image for example.

We should create said board by looping through the `cells` array from our game's state (`G`). If a cell is unmarked  and it's clicked, it should *mark itself* with current player's character by calling the `markCell` move with the cell's index. You know the drill:

```html
<script setup lang="ts">
import { inject, Ref } from 'vue';

import { BoardgameIoClient } from '@/client';
import { State } from '@/types';
import { playerHtmlEntity } from '@/utils/playerHtmlEntity';

const client = inject<Ref<BoardgameIoClient>>('client');
const G = inject<Ref<State>>('G');
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <div
      v-for="(cell, index) in G?.cells"
      :key="index"
      v-html="playerHtmlEntity(cell)"
      @click="client?.moves.markCell(index)"
    ></div>
  </div>
</template>
```

There are two things I'd like to explain before we move on to styling. First one is the fact that Vue *appends* undefined type to each one passed via `inject`, therefore we'll always be forced to use optional chaining when accessing injected refs' properties.

The second one is the use of built-in `v-html` directive, instead of the good ol' mustache syntax. If we were to make use of the latter, each HTML entity string returned by our utility would be displayed *as-is* instead of getting *converted* to a proper Unicode character. Furthermore, utilising `v-html` in this scenario is totally safe, because it's impossible for the user to set a custom cell value, and even if it was, the `playerHtmlEntity` would simply return `undefined` due to such value not being a key of `entityMap`.

We're yet to properly style the game board. Add `id="tic-tac-toe-board"` to the root div and put a `<style scoped>` tag below the `<template>`, starting with this simple rule:

```css
#tic-tac-toe-board {
  display: grid;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```

Tic Tac Toe board is a prime example of an ordered layout, so using CSS Grid is a no-brainer here. What could be less obvious though, is setting `overflow: hidden;`, but it will make more sense in a minute, trust me ;). Before that, we'll need to come back to our `<template>` in order to assign our cell divs, `cell` classes, but also a dynamic `unmarked` class, which I'm positive speaks for itself too. We can combine the array and object class syntax to achieve this:

```html
<div
  v-for="(cell, index) in G?.cells"
  :key="index"
  :class="['cell', { unmarked: cell === null }]"
  v-html="playerHtmlEntity(cell)"
  @click="client?.moves.markCell(index)"
></div>
```
