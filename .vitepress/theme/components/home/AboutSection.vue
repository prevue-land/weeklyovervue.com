          Hey! My name is Maciej PÄ™dzich, but you can call me Mac. I started
          Weekly OverVue, because I'd been looking for
          <strong>active</strong> blogs covering
          <strong>standalone, community</strong> Vue/Nuxt components, plugins,
          themes, etc. <em>in action</em>. Or in other words - their potential
          use-cases in <strong>actual applications</strong>. But as you've
          probably guessed by now - I'd <strong>failed</strong> to find any
          blogs that would match the criteria.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weekly OverVue aims to do so by <strong>regularly</strong> providing
          articles <strong>guiding</strong> you through the development process
          of projects which are <strong>built around</strong> a certain
          <em>third-party</em> component. That way, not only are you given a
          <strong>demonstration</strong> of its capabilities in a
          <em>real-life</em> scenario, but also a potential
          <strong>baseline</strong> for your future Vue or Nuxt project. This
          includes suggestions regarding its <strong>tech stack</strong>, as
          well as a list of features required for an <strong>MVP</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lastly - each post is
          <a
            href="https://weeklyovervue.hashnode.dev"
            rel="noreferrer noopener"
          >
            available on Hashnode
          </a>
          too, which means you <strong>won't</strong> have to worry about
          <strong>losing access</strong> to any Weekly OverVue article should
          this page become unavailable for whatever reason.
